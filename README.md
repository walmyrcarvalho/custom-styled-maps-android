This example will be presented on my talk on [Android Meetup #43](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/GDG-SP/events/236623989/)! :robot:

## About the Google Maps API key
The Google Maps API key used on it is hosted on my personal account, so if it stop working in some way just [create your own key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key
) and replace the `google_maps_key` value on the `google_maps_api.xml` file with your own key value.

## How to run it?
Just clone the project and import the project on Android Studio on `File > Open Project`, easy! :heart:
